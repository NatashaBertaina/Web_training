                <p>Exploring the cosmos through different senses can be within your reach. That's why this platform for training in the sonification of astronomical data and more was created. In the convergence between astronomy and data sonification, we have created a unique space that goes beyond visual representation, allowing you to discover the universe in a multisensory way.</p>
