"                            Exploring the cosmos through different senses "
"can be within your reach. That's why this platform for training in the "
"sonification of astronomical data and more was created. In the convergence "
"between astronomy and data sonification, we have created a unique space that "
"goes beyond visual representation, allowing you to discover the universe in "
"a multisensory way.\n"
